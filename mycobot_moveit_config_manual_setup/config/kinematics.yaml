# Configures how a robot calculates possible positions and movements of its joints 
# to reach a desired point. It specifies which mathematical methods (solvers) to use, 
# how long to try, and how precise these calculations should be.

# Typically we don't need a complex kinematics solver for the gripper. This is for demonstration purposes only.
